        <!-- verse 1 Gotye -->
        <div>
            <p>
            Now and then, I <span class="sadBlue"> think </span> of when we were together <br>
            Like when you said you felt <span class="happyYellow"> So Happy</span>, you could <span class="happyYellow"> Die </span><br>
            I told myself that you were <span class="happyYellow"> Right </span> for me <br>
            But felt so <span class="sadBlue">lonely</span> in your company <br>
            But that was <span class="strong"> love </span> and it's an <span class="strong"> Ache</span> I still remember <br>
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- verse 2 Gotye -->
        <div>
            <p>
            You can get <span class="sadBlue">addicted</span> to a certain kind of <span class="sadBlue">sadness</span> <br>
            Like <span class="strong">resignation</span> to the end, always <span class="sadBlue">the end</span> <br>
            So when we found that we could not make sense <br>
            Well, you said that we would still be <span class="strong">friends</span> <br>
            But I'll admit that I was <span class="happyYellow">glad</span> it was over <br>
            </p>
        </div>

            <p>
            <span class="strong">But you didn't have to cut me off <br>
            Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing <br>
            And I don't even need your love <br>
            But you treat me like a stranger </span> <span class="sadBlue">and that feels so rough</span> <br>
            <br>
           <span class="strong"> No, you didn't have to stoop so low <br>
            Have your friends collect your records and then change your number <br>
            I guess that I don't need that, though</span> <br>
            <span class="sadBlue">Now, you're just somebody that I used to know </span><br>
            <span class="sadBlue">Now, you're just somebody that I used to know </span><br>
            <span class="sadBlue">Now, you're just somebody that I used to know </span><br>

        <!-- verse 3 Kimbra-->
        <div>
            <p>
            Now and then, I think of all the times you <span class="sadBlue">screwed</span> me over <br>
            But had me <span class="sadBlue">believing</span> it was always something that I'd done <br>
            But I <span class="strong">don't wanna live</span> that way <br>
            Reading into <span class="sadBlue">every word</span> you say <br>
            You said that you could <span class="strong">let it go</span> <br>
            And I wouldn't catch you hung up on <span class="strong">somebody that you used to know</span> <br>
            </p>
